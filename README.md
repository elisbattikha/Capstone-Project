# Capstone Project
The purpose of this assignment is to implement a depth first search (DFS) algorithm to find the largest file on your hard drive. I have explained DFS in a previous lecture and you can a lot of information on Web, e.g.:

https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/graphs/depth-first-search/tutorial/ (Links to an external site.)
To verify that the implementation of your algorithm works correctly and the largest file can indeed be identified, a breads first (BFS) search algorithm needs to be implemented in the unit test.

Again, I have explained BFS in a previous lecture and you can find lots of info on Web, e.g.

Should there not be a clear winner (more than one file qualify as the largest) then use the one with the longest path. If there is still not winner, use the one you found last.
